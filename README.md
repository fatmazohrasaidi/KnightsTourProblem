# Knight's Tour Solver  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project solves the **Knight's Tour problem**, where a knight moves on a chessboard, visiting each square exactly once. Two different approaches are implemented using **Python**:  
**Genetic Algorithm (GA)** - An evolutionary approach to finding solutions.  
**Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** - A logical constraint-based approach (found in the `3.knights_tour` folder).  

## ðŸ›  Features  
- **Genetic Algorithm Approach**:
  - Uses mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve a valid knightâ€™s tour.  
  - Implements fitness evaluation to optimize solutions over generations.  
- **CSP Approach**:
  - Models the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem.  
  - Uses constraint propagation and backtracking techniques.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
**1-Run the Genetic Algorithm Solver**

**2-Run the CSP Solver**
